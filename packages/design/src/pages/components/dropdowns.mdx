Dropdowns expand to reveal a menu of options. They close themselves when the user clicks out of them.

<ResearchAside>
  Most users will never expand these unless they are super confident the option
  they want may be inside. Are you usre you want to use this pattern?
</ResearchAside>

## Accesibility

If you use this component the following things are already taken care of for you:

<List>
  <HappyListItem>
    Upon activating a dropdown, focus should shift _inside_ the element
  </HappyListItem>
  <HappyListItem>
    Screen readers should be able to tell an active link from an active link
  </HappyListItem>
  <HappyListItem>
    Keyboard input and focus should be trapperd inside the dropdown
  </HappyListItem>
</List>

You still need to make sure these other things happen:

- Upon dismissing a dropdown, focus should return to where it originally was. (It is safe to assume focus was at the trigger link.)
- Provide at least one way to close the dropdown using a keyboard. Add a hidden "Close" link at the end
